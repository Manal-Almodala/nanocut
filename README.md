Nanocut
=======

Nanocut is a program designed to cut various objects from three
dimensional crystal structures. It is aimed to be helpful when
creating geometry input for atomistic simulations. Currently it can
create following objects:

* Spherical cluster
* Polyhedral cluster
* Cylindrical cluster
* Spherical wire (1D periodic)
* Polyhedral wire (1D periodic)
* Plain slab (2D periodic)
