\subsubsection{Convex polyhedron}

A convex polyhedron is defined by the planes delimiting the body. A plane can be defined using miller indices or the normal vector. The body's section is opened by \lstinline{[convex_polyhedron: NAME]}.

\paragraph{Parameters}

\begin{description}
 \item{\lstinline{planes_miller}} Miller indices of each plane (except those defined using normal vectors) followed by its distance from the origin.
 \item{\lstinline{planes_normal}} Vector orthogonal to each plane (except those defined using miller indices) followed by its distance from the origin. The vectors do not need to be normalized.
\end{description}
