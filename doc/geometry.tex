\section{Geometry - defining unit cells} 
The \lstinline{geometry} section contains the information required to create the crystal structure. Only one geometry section if every INI file is allowed and in case of multiple entries only the last one will be used. It requires always two parameters and only a third one is enabled.

\paragraph{Parameters}
The \lstinline{geometry} section requires the two entries \lstinline{lattice_vectors} and \lstinline{basis_coordsys}.
\begin{description}
 \item{lattice\_vectors} \lstinline{lattice_vectors} contains the unit vectors of a unit cell of the crystal in cartesian coordinates. Of course three and only three entries are allowed which may not be linear dependant upon one another or empty. The vectors are to be given one vector after another.
 \item{basis} \lstinline{basis} contains all the atoms included in a unit cell. The atoms are each to be noted beginning with their chemical symbol followed by their coordinate in the unit cell.
\end{description}
