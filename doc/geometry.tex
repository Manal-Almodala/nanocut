\section{Geometry - defining unit cells} 
\subsection{Definition}
The geometry section includes the information to create the basic crystal structure. Therefore it requires the lattice vectors in cartesian coordinates properly defining the unit cell boundaries and the atoms included in one unit cell.

\subsection{Usage}
Geometry section requires only two entries at all times and enables onlz a single third one.\\
