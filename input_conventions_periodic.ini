;The input file is required to be an ini type!
;
;<item>_coordsys-item
;You can specify the coordinate system used for almost every item
;containing vectors by adding an <item>_coordsys-item
;inside the section which contains <item>.
;This does not apply to the lattice_vector-item.
;It is required to be in cartesian coordinates.
;Possible arguments: "cartesian", "lattice"
;Be sure to note all defaults are "lattice"!
;
;Example:
;basis_coordsys: cartesian
;
;Please be careful concerning your choice of numbers.
;Not integer values must be given as proper floats or the input
;may be misinterpreted.
;
;Please note: Assigning multiple items with identical names will cause only
;the last item to be used when processing.
;
;Every body (so every section except for geometry) features an order item
;which is (as of now) required to be a positive integer.
;Bodies will be calculated in the specified order.
;Multiple bodies may be given the same order.
;Bodies with an even integer will be removed from the momentary amount of atoms,
;bodies with an uneven order are added.
;All bodies default order is 1.
;Bodies with order 0 or less will be ignored.

;Every ini must have a [geometry]-section!
[geometry]

;The [geometry]-section must have a lattice_vectors-item
;containing the concatenation of the three lattice vectors!
;The elements need to be separated by white spaces and given in horizontal shape!
;(first line: first vector
;second line: second vector...)
2;Example:
lattice_vectors: 1.8 1.8 0
                 0 1.8 1.8
                 1.8 0 1.8

;The [geometry]-section must have a basis-item
;containing the concatenation of the atom's identifiers
;followed by their basis vectors!
;The elements need to be separated by whitespaces.
